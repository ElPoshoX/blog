My name is Azgad García Zúñiga, but the bandita calls me **Az** for short and because it's hard to pronounce my name lol, and I have a nickname acquired since I was young which is “poshox” which I decided to keep just for nostalgia.

I have studies in **computer science** (bachelors and masters) and at some point I plan to finally do my PhD in the same.

**I really enjoy solving any engineering or product problem I can**, as well as helping people solve theirs, always thinking that I wish I had had someone like that when I was aimless in my early years.

My areas of expertise are **Cloud**, **DevOps**, **Platform Engineering**, **Chaos Engineering** and **SRE**, but I have also served as a Software Developer, DBA and SysAdmin.

I currently work as **Principal Technical Architect** and provide external consulting on any of the other topics. :rocket:
